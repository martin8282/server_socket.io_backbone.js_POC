# Seed [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/qualiancy/seed.png)](http://travis-ci.org/qualiancy/seed)

## Storage-agnostic Event Emitting Datasets

Seed is a library of components that provide a common API for working with sets of data, no matter the source.

* *Hashs* provide a thorough API for key:value sets. These sets can be simple string key to number value, or 
string key to object/document value. Hashs are used extensively througout the internals of the other components.
* *Schema*: A schema is a definition of data structure expecatations and are currently used for validation. Those
who have used Mongoose will find the API familiar.
* *Model*: A model defines all aspects and behavior related to a single instance in a set. More specifically, 
when used in conjunction with storage, a model represents one document in a collection or one row in a table. 
* *Graph*: A graph is a collection of instantiated models. Though similiar to Backbone Collections, a Graph
allows for logical groupings of several types of models.

### Some possible implementations:

* Realtime notifications of status updates on social networks.
* KPI monitoriing and alerts based on realtime sales data for shopping sites.
* Evented ETL network

## Installation

Package is available through [npm](http://npmjs.org).

    $ npm install seed

## Storage Engines

Seed comes with a Memory based storage engine. Need an alternative?

* [seed-filestore](http://github.com/qualiancy/seed-filestore) - Store your datasets in a JSON based file structure.
* [seed-redis](http://github.com/qualiancy/seed-redis) - Store your datasets in a [Redis](http://redis.io) database.

## Where to Get Help

Please post issues to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/logicalparadox/seed/issues).
Community forum is available at the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/seedjs-orm).

## Components

Seed consists of four main components:

### Hash

### Schema

### Model

### Graph

## Tests

Tests are writting in [Mocha](http://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) using the [Chai](http://chaijs.com)
`should` BDD assertion library. Make sure you have that installed, clone this repo, install dependacies using `npm install`.

    $ make test
