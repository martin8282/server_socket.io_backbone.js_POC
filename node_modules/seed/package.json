These sets can be simple string key to number value, or \nstring key to object/document value. Hashs are used extensively througout the internals of the other components.\n* *Schema*: A schema is a definition of data structure expecatations and are currently used for validation. Those\nwho have used Mongoose will find the API familiar.\n* *Model*: A model defines all aspects and behavior related to a single instance in a set. More specifically, \nwhen used in conjunction with storage, a model represents one document in a collection or one row in a table. \n* *Graph*: A graph is a collection of instantiated models. Though similiar to Backbone Collections, a Graph\nallows for logical groupings of several types of models.\n\n### Some possible implementations:\n\n* Realtime notifications of status updates on social networks.\n* KPI monitoriing and alerts based on realtime sales data for shopping sites.\n* Evented ETL network\n\n## Installation\n\nPackage is available through [npm](http://npmjs.org).\n\n    $ npm install seed\n\n## Storage Engines\n\nSeed comes with a Memory based storage engine. Need an alternative?\n\n* [seed-filestore](http://github.com/qualiancy/seed-filestore) - Store your datasets in a JSON based file structure.\n* [seed-redis](http://github.com/qualiancy/seed-redis) - Store your datasets in a [Redis](http://redis.io) database.\n\n## Where to Get Help\n\nPlease post issues to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/logicalparadox/seed/issues).\nCommunity forum is available at the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/seedjs-orm).\n\n## Components\n\nSeed consists of four main components:\n\n### Hash\n\n### Schema\n\n### Model\n\n### Graph\n\n## Tests\n\nTests are writting in [Mocha](http://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) using the [Chai](http://chaijs.com)\n`should` BDD assertion library. Make sure you have that installed, clone this repo, install dependacies using `npm install`.\n\n    $ make test\n\n## Contributors\n\nInterested in contributing? Fork to get started.
